 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                          Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

                          Terms and Conditions

  1. You are granted the right to use, modify, and distribute the Wandulu Timothy WordPress theme.

  2. Any modified versions of the theme must also be distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

  3. The Wandulu Timothy WordPress theme is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the Wandulu Timothy WordPress theme or the use or other dealings in the theme.

                          How to Apply These Terms

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the theme. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
